Motor PWM: 5 kHz
PWM resolution: 12 bits (20 MHz ticks)

Encoder I2C freq: 1 MHz
R/W ANGLE sample: 27 bits
Max. read rate: 30 kHz
Real sampling rate: 1 / 150 µs = 6.7 kHz

15 motors, each comprising:
- 2x power line (VM, GND)
- 1x capacitive sensor line — hanging
- 1x encoder SDA line
- 6x motor control line (3-phase EN/IN)
- 2x LED line (3x?) — hanging
totalling 3x (4x?) hanging, ~12x routed, where 3x (VM, GND, SCL) common and the rest exclusive

STM32F103Cx has 37 GPIOs

What if each unit (motor + encoder — servo, LED, cap. sensor) is controlled by SPI?
- 2x power line (VM, GND)
- 2x SPI lines (CSN, SDA — half-duplex)
- Updated at 1 kHz, each 10 bytes = 90 bits
- Unit MCU needs 6 PWM (3 motor, 3 LED) + 3 motor EN + 2 I2C + 1 Cap

STM32G030F6 GPIO AF setup:
- SPI2: 3 lines
- PWM: 6 lines (2-4 timers)
- I2C: 2 lines
